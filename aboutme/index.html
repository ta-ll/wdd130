    <h2>Tanner Lowe</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Tanner Lowe. I was born in Utah but spent most of my life in Normal, Illinois. But, I love the West too much. I moved out West as soon as I could after my mission. I am currently pursuing a degree in Business Management. </p> 
    <p>In my free time, I like to go on hikes, read, shooting, and play videogames. I also dabble a little bit in music production.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church my entire life. I love this quote from Elder Bednar,</p> 
    <p><q>The gospel of the Savior is not simply about avoiding bad in our lives; it also is essentially about doing and becoming good. And the Atonement provides help for us to overcome and avoid bad and to do and become good. Help from the Savior is available for the entire journey of mortalityâ€”from bad to good to better and to change our very nature.</q></p>
